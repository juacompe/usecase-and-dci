I copied `example0_from_roles_library.py` from [here](https://github.com/amolenaar/roles/blob/master/example.py).


Setup
---
Install required libraries (I suggest do it in a `virtualenv`).

```
pip install -r setup.pip
```

Example 0
----
The code is copied from [example](https://github.com/amolenaar/roles/blob/master/example.py) in [roles library](https://github.com/amolenaar/roles)

```
python python example0_from_roles_library.py
```

Example 1
----
To run model's unit tests:

```
nosetests
```

To run context BDD tests:

```
lettuce tests/
```

Did I credit the source of the example 0 which came from <https://github.com/amolenaar/roles/blob/master/example.py>?
